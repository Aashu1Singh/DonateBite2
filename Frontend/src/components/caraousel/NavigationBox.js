          Indiaâ€™s primary issue is lack of cold chains and adequate storage facilities leading to a large amount of loss along the supply chain. This, coupled with rising incomes and lack of awareness on the issue of food waste, plays an important role in India's contribution to environmental degradation today.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not only do we need to put surplus food back into the food chain but we also need to secure food for future generations at a low environmental cost.
